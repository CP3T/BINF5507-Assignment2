Regression and Classification Models

Objectives: ● Train and evaluate machine learning models for regression and classifi cation tasks.● Visualize and interpret hyperparameter effects.● Reflect on model selection and insights.

This assignment was meant to improve our skills in regression modelling but using the different concepts learnt from class and labs.
A script was developed from scratch using the heart_disease_uci dataset to predict cholesterol levels and predict the presence of heart disease.
Linear regression model was built and evaluated to predict the cholesterol levels. R2 and RMSE were used as evaluation metrics. 
Then, Logistic Regression and k-NN Classifiers were trained and evaluated. Accuracy, F1 score, AUROC and AUPRC were used as evuation metrics.
